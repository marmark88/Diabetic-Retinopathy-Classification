# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification ML Report

## Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify diabetic retinopathy severity from retinal images. The CNN predicts one of five classes:

- Healthy  
- Mild  
- Moderate  
- Severe  
- Proliferative  

It combines two publicly available Kaggle datasets, handles class imbalance, and evaluates performance using Top-K accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC curves.
